# Odin_Calculator

01/29/21 - Added base functionality for the calculator, still has a lot of bug fixing to do. Calculator currently cannot do multiple calculations, and can only calculate one at a time.

01/31/21 - Calculator is fully functional, but there is still a lot of bug fixing to do. You currently cannot string multiple calculations at the same time. But this will be fixed later :)

Bugs to Fix

Multiple strings of calculations without hitting equals (DONE)
Disable equal button when two numbers are not yet processed (DONE)
Support for decimals and rounding decimal numbers (DONE)
prevent from dividing by 0 (SOMEHOW DONE / WILL POLISH LATER)

Features Yet To be added

Keyboard Support (DISCARDED)

01/31/21 - Calculator is finished from now. It's been very though working with this project but I managed to pull through. There are still limitations like there is no current digit limit, meaning you can go beserk and calculate as many digits as you can (not advisable) and dividing by zero can mess up the calculator. Other than that, calculator is good for use and these bugs will be fixed later. Now its time for me to move to greener grass.
